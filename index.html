       I am an 18 year old male student who is currently attending the University of California Riverside for the very first time. I am enrolled in the pre-business program in order to eventually qualify for the School of Business. I do not have experience as of yet in any job as I have not gotten the opportunity due having my sole focus on school. Past experiences that I do have are all school related. In high school I participated in STEM heavy programs such as PLTW, MESA, Robotics, and ACE. In each program I managed to learn about engineering, programming, and team building. As part of each program, I competed in a combined 17 different competitions. In each competition, our school always made sure to leave with a prize. With my knowledge in programming and engineering, I have managed to continue to hone my skills as I have helped teach others how to program. I also currently am part of an intro to computer science class where I continue to learn new and innovating ways of doing things in a technological sense. If I could describe myself in a few words, it would be prepared, knowledgeable, straight to the point, and always learning. I believe no one ever stops learning, as there is always something new to discover.
<br><br>
         I believe that any job that hires me is one that will be taken to the next level. Although I mentioned that i do not currently have any job experience, I believe I possess the necessary skills to help make a company successful. I am someone who is determined to leave a place better than I found it. I believe that you get what you put into a job, and I strive to work at my best everyday. With my knowledge I know I can be a valuable asset to any company. Whether itâ€™d be independent work or group work, I can work under any circumstances and any pressure. Some other accomplishments I gained in school are 3 principal awards, placed on honor roll in all my years of school, and a 2-time spelling bee winner. The reason I mention these awards is to show that I can compete with others if necessary and that I can do as instructed. Another valuable asset that I possess and that I believe is valuable to any company, is the fact that I have a diverse background as a latino. As alatino, I am both an english and spanish speaker, and can translate if necessary. I also bring a different point of view to a company and offer the diversity that is desperately needed in many companies. What many may think is a good idea in their own views, I can offer my own ideas from my own perspective to show others what they may not understand. Other skills I possess include experience in graphic design, 3D modeling, and photography. Through my creative and technological skills, I donâ€™t see why it would be anything but the right decision to make to hire me for work. I may not have past experience, but I believe that with what I have to offer, I contain lots of potential.
